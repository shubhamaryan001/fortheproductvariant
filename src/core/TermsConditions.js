                <p>
                  Our design team tries to design your floorplan as soon as
                  possible. At the moment we take anywhere between 24 - 48 Hrs
                  to email you the designs. All designs take time and some take
                  additional time based on the complexity of the design.

                <h4 className="text-muted">VAASTU POLICY</h4>
                <p>
                  If you choose to get your house designed as per
                  vaastu-shastra. We try providing 100% vaastu as per its
                  principles. Although, despite our best efforts, due to various
                  limitations in terms of ventilation, space constraints and
                  plot size, we do not guarantee that the house designed for you
                  will be fully vaastu compliant, few deviations from vaastu
                  norms may be required to ensure good ventilation and good
                  floorplan layout.
                  <br />
                  Small plots always have some limitations in designing floor
                  plans as per vaastu principles. 100% vaastu can only be
                  achieved in a plot having setbacks from all four sides and no
                  constrain for ventilation and room sizes.
                  <br /> We do not design the house as per any special vaastu or
                  as per the requirements of your vaastu pandit. We will not be
                  able to comply with your requests in such cases where you wish
                  that the house be designed as per your specific vaastu norms.
                  We will only design the house as per the standard vaastu
                  principles that FloorplanBazaar.com follows.

                <h4 className="text-muted">SUBJECTIVE POLICY</h4>
                <p>
                  We take great care while designing your dream home. Our
                  architecture design team ensures that most of your
                  requirements are incorporated in the design, yet sometimes
                  it’s not possible to properly design with the limitations of
                  space due to plot dimensions. We try our best in giving equal
                  & best service to everyone and try to satisfy your
                  requirements, yet we do not provide any guarantee that our
                  services or designs will fully satisfy you.
                  <br />
                  Design is subjective in nature, the same design may be
                  appreciated by some and criticized by others.
                  <br /> In such rare cases, where you find that you are not
                  happy with the design or service provided by
